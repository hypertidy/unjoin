# unjoin

The goal of unjoin is to provide `unjoin` for data frames. This is used to build topological data structures, with a
kind of inside-out version of a nested data frame. Whether it's of broader use is an open question. 

## Installation

You can install unjoin from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mdsumner/unjoin")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to unjoin a data frame. 

```{r example}
library(unjoin)

unjoin(iris)

library(dplyr)
iris %>% unjoin(Species)

iris %>% unjoin(Species, Petal.Width)
```
