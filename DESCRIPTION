Description: Separate a data frame in two based on key columns. The function 'unjoin' is an inside-out 
   version of a nested data frame.  This is used to identify duplication and normalize it
   (in the database sense) by linking two tables with the redundancy removed. This is a basic 
   requirement for detecting topology within spatial structures, though might also have other uses.
